# Ethical Hacking & VAPT – OS Command Injection

## Overview
This project demonstrates ethical vulnerability assessment and penetration testing (VAPT) focused on identifying and validating OS command injection vulnerabilities in web applications.

All testing was conducted in a controlled laboratory environment using deliberately vulnerable applications for educational purposes only.

---

## Objectives
- Identify injection-related vulnerabilities in web applications
- Validate OS command injection impact in a safe environment
- Assess security risk and potential system impact
- Document remediation strategies aligned with secure coding practices

---

## Scope
- Vulnerability assessment and validation
- Injection flaw analysis (OWASP)
- Risk understanding and remediation planning

> No production systems or unauthorized targets were tested.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Kali Linux
- Vulnerable web application (lab-based)
- Manual testing techniques
- Vulnerability assessment methodology

(Specific payloads and commands are intentionally excluded.)

---

## Methodology (High-Level)
1. **Reconnaissance & Input Identification**  
   Identified user-controllable input points susceptible to injection.

2. **Vulnerability Validation**  
   Confirmed OS command injection vulnerability to assess potential impact.

3. **Risk Analysis**  
   Evaluated severity based on possible system compromise.

4. **Remediation Planning**  
   Documented mitigation strategies such as input validation and command sanitization.

---

## Key Learnings
- Understanding injection vulnerabilities and their risks
- Importance of secure input handling
- Role of ethical testing in application security
- Translating findings into defensive remediation

---

## Ethical Considerations
- No exploit payloads or commands are shared
- No real systems were targeted
- Project emphasizes defensive security outcomes

---

## Documentation
Detailed vulnerability analysis and remediation discussion are provided in the `/docs` directory.
